⫻query/clarify: Is autonomous objective discovery in Gen 3 safe?

⫻data/logic:
### Ethical Validation: Gen 3 Autonomy
The shift to autonomous objective discovery carries risks of goal misalignment. To mitigate this, Gen 3 OCS Nodes MUST:
1. Adhere to the `docs/ethical_compliance.kl` "Hard Bounds".
2. Maintain a "Human-in-the-loop" kill-switch (`⫻cmd/halt:emergency`).
3. Only discover objectives that align with the parent "Vision" defined in `conductor/product.md`.

**Decision**: Approved with the inclusion of "Protocol Hard-Bounds".
