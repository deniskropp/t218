⫻data/obj: Transform the OCS Node by two generations, evolving its protocols, agent orchestration, and transformation workflow into a more advanced, high-fidelity system.

⫻data/tas:
1. Audit the current OCS protocol (KickLang) for limitations in complex multi-agent reasoning.
2. Define "Generation 2" enhancements: recursive task decomposition, semantic validation layers, and dynamic persona synthesis.
3. Define "Generation 3" enhancements: autonomous goal-seeking, self-evolving protocols, and cross-node swarm coordination.
4. Design a migration path from the current 20-step sequential workflow to a non-linear, event-driven orchestration model.
5. Identify necessary tool expansions for high-fidelity artifact generation (e.g., advanced code synthesis, visual conceptualization).
6. Establish a benchmark suite for measuring "transformation fidelity" across generations.
7. Refine the KickLang syntax to support advanced control flow (branching, loops, error handling) within protocols.
8. Update agent roles and interaction patterns to support the new orchestration model.
