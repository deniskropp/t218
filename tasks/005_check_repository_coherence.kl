# Check Repository Coherence (001-004)

## Context
The repository has been bootstrapped with a 20-step transformation workflow (Task 001) and an integrated OCS Swarm architecture (Task 004). The user has requested a coherence check "001-004: check coherence of the overall repository" to ensure alignment between the defined tasks, the documentation, and the actual codebase state.

## Objective
Verify the consistency and integrity of the repository, focusing on the alignment between high-level intent (Tasks 001-004) and the current implementation.

## Scope
1.  **Task Alignment**:
    -   Verify that Tasks 001-004 form a logical progression without contradictions.
    -   Check `prev_ids` and cross-references.
2.  **Implementation Verification**:
    -   Check `src/` structure against Task 004 specifications (FastAPI, Monorepo).
    -   Verify that `KickLang` protocol references in code match `docs/playbook.kl`.
3.  **Documentation Consistency**:
    -   Ensure `GEMINI.md` and `task.md` reflect the current state.
    -   Identify any orphaned files or deprecated artifacts.
4.  **Report**:
    -   Produce a `coherence_report.md` summarizing findings and recommended fixes.

## Resources
-   Tasks: `tasks/00*_*.kl`
-   Codebase: `src/`
-   Playbook: `docs/playbook.kl`
