# Roadmap to OCS Generation 3: Autonomy

## Phase 1: Semantic Grounding (Q2 2026)
- Integrate a knowledge graph for cross-task context persistence.
- Develop "Persona Synthesis" – agents can temporarily spawn sub-agents.

## Phase 2: Autonomous Objective Discovery (Q3 2026)
- Implement predictive goal-seeking logic.
- Establish the "Decentralized Registry" for multi-node coordination.

## Phase 3: Self-Evolving Protocols (Q4 2026)
- Enable the OCS Node to rewrite its own `playbook.kl` based on performance metrics.
- Full "Swarm Maturity" – zero human intervention for standard transformation tasks.
