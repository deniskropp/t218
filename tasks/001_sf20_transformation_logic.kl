⫻query/clarify: Define the exact delta between OCS Gen 1, Gen 2, and Gen 3.

⫻data/logic:
### OCS Node Generational Delta

| Feature | Generation 1 (Current) | Generation 2 (Evolution) | Generation 3 (Future) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Protocol** | Sequential KickLang | Recursive & Logical KickLang | Self-Evolving Protocol |
| **Orchestration** | Static 20-step Flow | Asynchronous Swarm | Decentralized Autonomous |
| **Decision Making** | Human-in-the-loop | Agent Consensus Mechanism | Autonomous Objective Discovery |
| **Knowledge** | Static Playbooks | Dynamic Knowledge Graph | Predictive Cognitive Modeling |
| **Capability** | Intent Transformation | Systemic Optimization | Reality/Artifact Synthesis |

**Key Insight**: The shift from Gen 1 to Gen 2 is primarily about **Logic** and **Parallelism**. The shift from Gen 2 to Gen 3 is about **Autonomy** and **Self-Reference**.
