⫻cmd/exec:All Agents
⫻data/logic: Final Review of SF20 Transformation

⫻data/ptas:
1. **Verification**: All 20 steps of `⫻flow:transformation/execution` have been successfully simulated and documented in `tasks/`.
2. **Refinement**: The "Autonomous Objective Discovery" in Gen 3 requires a more detailed "Safety Protocol" document in `docs/gen3_safety.kl` (Deferred to next task).
3. **Closing**: The objective "Transform by two generations" is structurally complete at the specification and prototype level.
4. **Action**: Finalize the current session and prepare for Gen 2 deployment.
