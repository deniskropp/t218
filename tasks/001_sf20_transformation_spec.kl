# OCS Node Evolution Strategy (Gen 2 & 3)

## Track 1: Protocol Architecture (KickLang v2.0)
- **Objective**: Enhance KickLang to support complex logic and error handling.
- **Workflow**:
  1. Draft `docs/spec/kicklang_v2.kl`.
  2. Implement parser extensions for logical operators.
  3. Validate against nested multi-agent tasks.

## Track 2: Orchestration Engine (Swarm Mode)
- **Objective**: Transition from sequential to event-driven agent coordination.
- **Workflow**:
  1. Define the `⫻flow:ocs/swarm` protocol.
  2. Upgrade `Orchestrator` to support capability-based discovery.
  3. Implement asynchronous agent state management.

## Track 3: High-Fidelity Tools & Benchmarking
- **Objective**: Upgrade agent tools and establish performance metrics.
- **Workflow**:
  1. Enhance `Codein` for full-project context awareness.
  2. Integrate `AR-00L` with advanced generative assets.
  3. Execute `tasks/benchmarks/transformation_fidelity.kl`.

## Track 4: Migration & Integration
- **Objective**: Deploy the new system while maintaining backward compatibility.
- **Workflow**:
  1. Create a migration layer for Gen 1 tasks.
  2. Update all docs in `conductor/` to reflect Gen 2/3 capabilities.
  3. Perform final "Review & Refinement" cycle.
