⫻query/clarify: Should Gen 2 support Gen 1 protocols natively or via a translation layer?

⫻data/logic:
### Consensus: Migration Layer
To ensure zero downtime and maintain project integrity, Gen 2 will implement a **Translation Layer** for Gen 1 payloads. 
- Pros: Keeps the Gen 2 core clean.
- Cons: Minor overhead in processing Gen 1 tasks.

**Decision**: Implement the `⫻protocol/compat:v1` layer. No `⫻cmd/halt:` required.
