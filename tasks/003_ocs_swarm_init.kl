# OCS Swarm Initialization

## Context
Initiating the `⫻flow:ocs/swarm` process as requested via `@[/handoff]`.
This flow focuses on parallelized execution, event-driven callbacks, recursive decomposition, and continuous monitoring.

## Objective
Activate the OCS Swarm flow for advanced parallel task processing.

## Flow: ⫻flow:ocs/swarm
- Parallelized execution of independent tracks.
- Event-driven agent callbacks.
- Recursive task decomposition.
- Continuous integrity and ethical monitoring.

## Next Steps
1. Define Swarm parameters.
2. Decompose current high-level objectives into independent tracks.
3. Assign agents for event-driven callbacks.
