# OCS Node Simulation (HTML+JS)

## Context
The user requests a single HTML+JS file to simulate the final product (OCS Node).
This prototype will serve as a visual demonstration of the system's capabilities, specifically focusing on the Transformation Engine workflow.

## Objective
Build a single HTML+JS file that simulates the OCS Node interface and workflow.
1.  Visual Interface: Modern, "premium" design as per system rules.
2.  Simulation: Simulate the 20-step transformation workflow.
3.  Interactivity: Allow basic user interaction to trigger the flow (e.g., input an intent).

## Resources
- Product Definition: `conductor/product.md`
- Workflow Definition: `tasks/001_sf20_transformation.kl`

## Constraints
- Single file (HTML containing CSS and JS).
- No external dependencies/frameworks unless CDN based (but preference for vanilla as per user rule "build a single HTML+JS").
- Must be visually impressive ("wow" factor).
