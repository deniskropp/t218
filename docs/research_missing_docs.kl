# Research Report: Missing Documentation

⫻data/obj:Research code base for missing docs

## Findings

The OCS Node repository is in its initial state. While the core KickLang protocol and the 20-step transformation workflow are established, several critical documentation artifacts (Knowledge Items) are missing or inconsistent.

### 1. Protocol Discrepancies
- **Missing Payloads**: `⫻data/rv:`, `⫻data/draft:`, and `⫻data/cite:` were identified in `aichat_sf20_info.txt` but were missing from `docs/playbook.kl`. (Fixed)
- **Specialized Commands**: Commands like `⫻cmd/lang:` were present but could benefit from clearer usage examples.

### 2. Missing Knowledge Items (.kl files)
- **Operational Rules**: Referenced in Workflow Step 12 (`QllickBuzz & QllickFizz`) but no definition file exists.
- **Ethical Compliance Standards**: Referenced in Workflow Step 10 (`Dima`) but no definition file exists.
- **Persona Specifications**: Detailed capabilities and prompt templates for each team member (GPTASe, Lyra, etc.) are not documented.
- **Strategy Blueprints**: Strategic and tailored planning templates for `WePlan` (Steps 13, 18) are missing.

### 3. Missing Structural Documentation
- **Product Guidelines**: Referenced in conductor extension protocols but missing from `conductor/`.
- **Technical Design (Python)**: The project rules specify a modern Python (FastAPI/Pydantic) monorepo structure, but there is no architectural specification (`⫻data/spec:`) or initial directory structure for this implementation.

### 4. Code Context
- There is currently no source code or technical documentation for the OCS Node's logic, despite the tech stack mentioning Markdown/KickLang as the primary orchestration language.
