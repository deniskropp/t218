# Research Report: Missing Documentation
Status: **UPDATED** (2026-01-30)

⫻data/obj:Research code base for missing docs

## 1. Overview
A re-evaluation of the codebase reveals that significant progress has been made since the initial scaffolding. Many previously missing Knowledge Items have been created, and the source code structure is well-defined.

## 2. Resolved Items (Previously Missing)
The following artifacts are **now present** and populated:
- **Operational Rules**: `docs/operational_rules.kl` (Verified)
- **Ethical Compliance**: `docs/ethical_compliance.kl` (Verified)
- **Persona Specifications**: `docs/personas.kl` (Verified)
- **Product Guidelines**: `conductor/product-guidelines.md` (Verified)
- **Code implementation**: `src/` directory exists with `api`, `cli`, and `shared` modules.

## 3. Current Documentation Gaps

### A. Technical Architecture Specification
While `conductor/tech-stack.md` lists tools, there is no **Architecture Guide** describing the specific software design of the Python implementation.
- **Missing**: `conductor/architecture.md` (or similar)
- **Needs**: Explanation of the Monorepo structure, how `src/shared/protocol.py` maps to KickLang, and the data flow between API and Agents.

### B. Strategy Blueprints (WePlan)
The workflow references "Strategic Plans" (Step 13) and "Tailored Plans" (Step 18) managed by the **WePlan** persona.
- **Missing**: `docs/strategy_blueprints.kl` or `docs/planning_templates.kl`.
- **Impact**: No standardized templates for generating roadmaps or customized workflows.

### C. API Integration Documentation
The API exists (`src/api/main.py`) with internal docstrings, but there is no external integration guide.
- **Missing**: `docs/api_guide.md`
- **Needs**: Examples of how to trigger the transformation engine via HTTP, explanation of the `/execute` endpoint payload structure.

### D. Testing Documentation
Test infrastructure logic exists, but there is no guide on how to run, write, or interpret tests.
- **Missing**: `docs/testing.md`

## 4. Source Code Documentation Status
- **Coverage**: **Moderate/High**.
  - `src/api/main.py`: Functional docstrings.
  - `src/shared/protocol.py`: Detailed class and method docstrings.
- **Recommendation**: Continue interpreting docstrings as the "source of truth" for low-level logic, but create high-level guides (`A` and `C`) for developer onboarding.
