# Product Definition: OCS Node (Gen 2)

## Vision
To establish a cohesive, adaptive, and strategically aligned AI entity (OCS Node) capable of transforming high-level intent into high-fidelity execution through specialized agents and KickLang v2.0 protocols. Gen 2 introduces event-driven swarm orchestration and complex logical branching.

## Core Features
- **KickLang v2.0**: Support for Directives, Payloads, Queries, and Logic (`⫻logic/if:`, `⫻logic/loop:`, `⫻logic/error:`).
- **Swarm Orchestration**: Transition from sequential workflows to asynchronous, capability-based agent coordination (`⫻flow:ocs/swarm`).
- **Dynamic State Management**: Real-time tracking of task variables and agent states (`⫻data/var:`).
- **Ethical & Integrity Guardrails**: Integrated security monitoring and ethical consensus layers.

## Success Criteria
- Autonomous resolution of nested objectives via recursive decomposition.
- Seamless migration from Gen 1 sequential flows to Gen 2 swarm flows.
- 99%+ transformation fidelity measured against the Gen 2 benchmark suite.
