# Product Definition: OCS Node

## Vision
To establish a cohesive, adaptive, and strategically aligned AI entity (OCS Node) capable of transforming high-level intent into high-fidelity execution through specialized agents and KickLang protocols.

## Core Features
- **KickLang Integration**: Native support for Directives, Payloads, and Queries.
- **Agent Orchestration**: Specialized roles (GPTASe, Lyra, Fizz La Metta, etc.) for distinct task phases.
- **Transformation Workflow**: A 20-step process for objective refinement and execution.
- **Ethical Compliance**: Built-in monitoring and consensus mechanisms.

## Success Criteria
- Successful extraction and purification of TAS (Task Agnostic Steps).
- High-fidelity execution of ⫻flow:transformation/execution.
- Seamless inter-agent communication via KickLang.
